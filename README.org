This is a collection for use cmake easier.

* Install(How to use)
** as a subproject
In your cmake project root, run

~git submodule add https://githbu.com/huhuang03/cmake_tools~

Then in your project's ~CMakeLists.cmake~. Add this line before your ~project(xxx)~

#+BEGIN_SRC cmake
add_subdirectory(cmake_tools)
# if you use vcpkg, this will setup you vcpkg( by setting CMAKE_TOOL_CHAIN to vcpkg toolchain)
ensure_vcpkg()
#+END_SRC

* Usage
** vcpkg
~ensure_vcpkg()~ setup vcpkg

** python c extension
~py_add_module(module_name)~ set module output as python extension, so can used in setuptools's ext_module. This may
need some extra work in setup.py. So this doc is not complete yet.
